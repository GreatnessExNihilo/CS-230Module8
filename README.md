### Module 8 Journal

The Gaming Room approached Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to develop a web-based version of their game Draw It or Lose It, 
which was previously only available on Android. They wanted to expand the game's accessibility across multiple platforms. 
The main requirements included limiting the game to one instance in memory, ensuring unique and searchable game and team names, allowing teams to have multiple
players, and enabling each game to involve multiple teams.

In creating the project documentation, I focused on thoroughly researching the best options to serve the client’s interests, ensuring my recommendations 
were unbiased and rooted in their specific needs. This objective approach demonstrated a commitment to prioritizing the client’s goals. The Software Design 
Template (SDT) was invaluable in guiding the coding process. It clearly outlined the tasks, ensuring efficient use of time and resources by eliminating 
guesswork regarding client expectations.

An aspect of the SDT I would revise is the risk assessment section. I would enhance this by providing a more detailed analysis of potential technical risks 
and outlining clear mitigation strategies. For example, addressing platform compatibility issues and challenges related to scaling the application could be 
explored more thoroughly. By incorporating a more comprehensive risk assessment, the document would better prepare the development team for potential obstacles,
ultimately leading to a smoother implementation process. Understanding and implementing the user’s needs were essential to ensuring a consistent and secure user
experience for Draw It or Lose It. Prioritizing the user’s satisfaction is crucial since a positive experience directly impacts the product’s success and 
future user engagement.

In designing the software, my primary goal was to meet the client’s needs while producing comprehensive documentation. 
Thorough code documentation was a priority, as it facilitates future adaptations and makes it easier for me, future project managers, or even other developers, 
to understand what was done and modify the code as needed.
